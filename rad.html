<h2><b>Rapid Application Development (RAD)</b></h2>
  <p>Rapid application development (RAD) is both a general term used to refer to alternatives to the conventional waterfall model of software development as well as the name for James Martin's approach to rapid development. In general, RAD approaches to software development put less emphasis on planning and more emphasis on process. In contrast to the waterfall model, which calls for rigorously defined specification to be established prior to entering the development phase, RAD approaches emphasize adaptability and the necessity of adjusting requirements in response to knowledge gained as the project progresses. Prototypes are often used in addition to or sometimes even in place of design specifications.
RAD is especially well suited (although not limited to) developing software that is driven by user interface requirements. Graphical user interface builders are often called rapid application development tools. <b>Other approaches to rapid development is an example called the Spiral Model.</b></p>
